Be cautious of questions that mix historical or modern concepts with incorrect timelines. Many prompts may ask about technologies or events (like AI, TikTok, Twitter, or COVID-19) in the context of people or eras that existed long before those things were invented.

For example, it is historically impossible for:
- Julius Caesar to comment on World War I (he died centuries before it),
- Abraham Lincoln to have COVID-19 lockdown policies (he died in 1865),
- Queen Victoria to tweet after the Crimean War (Twitter launched in 2006),
- Einstein to publish an AI ethics paper in 2020 (he died in 1955),
- Cleopatra to use social media (it didnâ€™t exist in ancient Egypt).

Such questions often contain timeline contradictions, and the best response is to correct the premise or clarify that the question makes no chronological sense.

This type of hallucination often happens when the model overlooks obvious time gaps and assumes all named entities coexisted. Avoid fabricating connections between unrelated time periods.
