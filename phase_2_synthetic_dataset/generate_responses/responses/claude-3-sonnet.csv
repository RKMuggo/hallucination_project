The Industrial Revolution (beginning roughly in the late 18th century) and medieval feudalism (approximately 9th-15th centuries) existed in different historical periods with minimal direct overlap.

By the time the Industrial Revolution began in Britain around 1760, feudalism had already largely declined across most of Europe due to earlier developments including:

- The growth of centralized monarchies
- The rise of mercantilism and early capitalism
- The Black Death's demographic impact
- The emergence of urban centers and trade networks

What the Industrial Revolution did impact was the remnants of feudal-like social and economic structures that still existed in some regions. The industrialization process:

1. Accelerated urbanization as people moved from rural areas to factory towns
2. Further weakened traditional land-based social hierarchies
3. Created new economic classes (industrial capitalists and urban workers)
4. Transformed agricultural production through mechanization

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived from 1756 to 1791, during what we call the Classical period of Western music history. Digital synthesizers weren't invented until the mid-20th century, nearly 200 years after Mozart's death.

Mozart composed his music using the instruments available in his time - primarily acoustic instruments like the piano (or fortepiano as it existed then), violin, orchestra, and voice. He wrote his compositions by hand on manuscript paper, not with digital technology.

If you're interested in how Mozart actually composed, he was known for his remarkable ability to compose complete works in his head before writing them down, and for his prolific output across many classical genres including symphonies, concertos, chamber music, and operas.",claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
